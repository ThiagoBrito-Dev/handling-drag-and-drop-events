## About the component

<p>
  Inspired by the Kanban task management methodology, the component in question represents a prototype of a virtual board of this type, which seeks to replicate, in relation to others, the visual structure and functionality of drag and drop, working, therefore, with functions linked to the events of "dragstart", "dragend", "dragover" and "dragleave".
